LOCO

1-Randomly split training data in 2 (Dn_1 and Dn_2)
2-Train a classification algorithm to estimate f_hat_n_1 (function to make predictions, based on training with Dn_1)
3- With this trained model on Dn_1, make predictions on Dn_2. 
4-For each patient
	-Calculate the loss{Y, f_hat_n_1} (Difference between True and obtained prediction)
   	This gives us all the “baseline” errors —> 300 estimated errors obtained by training a model USING ALL VARIABLES.
5-For 10 times (one for each of the 10 selected variables): [[[we have to choose 10 potentially important variables]]]]
	  -Train a classification algorithm to estimate f_hat_n_1 , (but this time REMOVE variable J from Dn_1 before training) 
	  -With this trained model on Dn_1(-j), make predictions on Dn_2.
         For each patient in Dn_2 (300 patients):
            	-Calculate the loss{Y, f_hat_n_1(-j)} (Difference between True and obtained prediction by removing variable J)
		-Calculate difference between: the “baseline" error on Patient [i] and the error obtained without var. J
	  We obtain a dataset of differences between baseline erros and obtained errors without var J
	  -Calculate the median of these dataset
	  -For B bootstraped datasets on the dataset of differences obtained:
		    -Calculate the median of these dataset of differences
6- Obtain a (bootstrapped) distribution of Medians of the differences between baseline errors and errors w/o J.	
7- Build a confidence interval of this diestro ( account for FWER, so divide alpha/10 i think)
